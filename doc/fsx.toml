# Sample FSX Configuration file
# Customize this file for each file system of interest

# Block mode: never change the file's size.
# This option is useful for testing block devices rather than file systems.
# When using block mode, FSX will never change the file's size, even at startup.
# The user must ensure that the file under test has the desired size before
# starting FSX.
#
# Usually, when testing block devices, one should also set:
# * opsize.align - to the block device's minimum allocation size
# * flen                      - do not set this at all
# * weights.close_open        - 0.0
# * weights.posix_fallocate   - 0.0
# * weights.truncate          - 0.0
# * -P                        - To anything except the device under test
