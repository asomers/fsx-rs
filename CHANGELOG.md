## [0.2.0] - 2023-12-29

### Added

- `copy_file_range`
  ([#43](https://github.com/asomers/fsx-rs/pull/43))

### Changed

- The CLI has been completely changed by the addition of a config file.  Now,
  most settings are specified in the config file.  Also:

  * close/open and invalidate are specified like other operations, not as
    modifiers that happen after an operation.

  * Seed-for-seed backwards compatibility is broken.  So you can't run fsx-rs
    and expect the exact same sequence of operations as would've been produced
    by legacy fsx.

  * Operations are now selected with variable weights instead of equal
    probabilities.

  * It is no longer possible to specify separate alignment requirements for
    read, write, and truncate.  Now the same alignment requirement applies to
    all.

  ([#23](https://github.com/asomers/fsx-rs/pull/23))

- Better usability when operating on block devices
  ([#35](https://github.com/asomers/fsx-rs/pull/35))

- Log verbosity is now controlled by the `-v` and `-q` flags instead of the
  `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
  ([#44](https://github.com/asomers/fsx-rs/pull/44))

- The MSRV is now 1.70.0

  ([#14](https://github.com/asomers/fsx-rs/pull/14))
